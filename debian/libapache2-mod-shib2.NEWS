shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  With this release, the Apache module configuration fragments in
  /etc/apache2/mods-available have been renamed to shib2.* from shib.* to
  avoid conflicts with libapache2-mod-shib.  If you had any customizations
  in /etc/apache2/mods-available/shib.load, you will need to move them to
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/shib2.load.
