shibboleth-sp2 (2.5.3+dfsg-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix server-side includes and directory indexes with Basic
      authentication when the Shibboleth module is loaded.
    - Fix preserved POST data size limit enforcement.
    - Fix POST data replay if a submit key is present.
    - Fix support for idpHistoryProps in Sessions.
  * Split shibboleth-sp2-common and shibboleth-sp2-utils packages off of
    libapache2-mod-shib2.  shibboleth-sp2-common contains the
    configuration, which is also required by the shared library.
    shibboleth-sp2-utils contains the shibd daemon plus the other utility
    commands that were in libapache2-mod-shib2.  (Closes: #740603)
  * Move /usr/include/shibsp/paths.h to the architecture-specific include
    directory, since it varies by architecture.  Thanks, Andreas
    Beckmann.  (Closes: #720036)
  * Disable the forcing of --silent mode in Libtool since Debian build log
    analysis wants verbose logs.
  * Stop symlinking the minimized jQuery installed by Doxygen and remove
    the dependency on libjs-jquery.  The Doxygen maintainers recommend
    against this approach since this file is apparently not just a
    straight copy of jQuery.
  * Remove the now-unnecessary dh_builddeb override to use xz compression.
  * Remove unnecessary dh_installinit parameters.  update-rc.d now uses
    LSB headers exclusively and no longer pays attention to any runlevel
    information on the command line.
  * Convert all Debian patches to separate patch files managed via gbp pq.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

shibboleth-sp2 (2.5.2+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New shib-session and shib-user Require authentication types added,
      which should be used in preference to Require valid-user or Require
      user with Shibboleth authentication is desired.
    - New ShibCompatValidUser Apache directive, which works around the way
      that Shibboleth hooks into Require valid-user and Require user so
      that those directives will continue to work with non-Shibboleth
      authentication types.  This directive will be needed for servers
      that use Shibboleth and other authentication methods and want to use
      Require valid-user or Require user with non-Shibboleth methods.
    - Fix implementation of shib-metagen -l.
    - Fix AttributeExtractor handling of multiple logos.
    - Fix metadata attribute extraction with non-ASCII characters.
    - Fix problems with Apache subrequests during server-side include
      handling of unprotected pages.
    - Add character set to DiscoFeed page header.
    - Avoid leaking shibd sockets to child processes.
  * Add NEWS entry for the authentication directive changes.
  * Update README.Debian instructions to add AuthType None to the URLs
    that have to be available to everyone and to use Require shib-session
    instead of Require valid-user.
  * Create /var/cache/shibboleth on install and remove it on purge.
  * Link the FastCGI programs with libxmltooling-lite since they call one
    of its interfaces directly.  (This shows up as a build failure
    otherwise due to the Debian build rules use of --as-needed.)

shibboleth-sp2 (2.5.1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #685069)
    - Support for Apache 2.4.  Please note there are some configuration
      incompabilities between Apache 2.4 and Apache 2.2.  See the upstream
      documentation at
      https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPApacheConfig
      for more information.  (Closes: #666804)
    - Disable the PKCS 1.5 algorithm for SAML assertion encryption by
      default for security reasons.  This can be re-enabled if necessary
      in the security-policy.xml configuration file.
    - The protocol between the Apache module and shibd has changed.  shibd
      will be restarted during upgrades, but if the module is configured
      to talk to a remote shibd over TCP, both the module and shibd must
      be upgraded at the same time.
    - Settings to limit redirections have been renamed from
      relayStateLimit and relayStateWhitelist to redirectLimit and
      redirectWhitelist respectively and the old names are deprecated (but
      still supported).
    - cookieProps has been simplified and warnings introduced if SSL
      restrictions are not enabled.
    - The <AttributeExtractor> element that loads the attribute-map.xml
      file now defaults to reloadChanges="false".  Restarting the SP when
      this file changes is recommended for security reasons.
    - Logging properties have been removed from the default configuration
      file and the absence of properties now indicates use of the default
      logging configuration files (shibd.logger and native.logger).
    - The native.log file is now created as root before Apache child
      initialization to minimize permission issues.
    - Files that persist across server restarts have been moved to
      /var/cache/shibboleth.
    - The example style sheet for error templates has been moved to a
      version-independent location in /usr/share/shibboleth.  A logo file
      is no longer included in the package to avoid accidental use of the
      Shibboleth logo on production sites.  If your existing error
      templates reference these files, you should correct this by copying
      files that you need to locations that you control.
    - The module should now be referenced as mod_shib.cpp in conditionals
      that want to reference a source file name.
    - Clients that bounce between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses should now be
      handled more smoothly.
    - SP initialization now fails if an external session cache is
      configured but cannot be opened.
  * Update libapache2-mod-shib2's README.Debian:
    - Use the Apache 2.4 authorization syntax.
    - Mention possibly having to grant access to /Shibboleth.sso.
    - The module is now enabled by default but still needs configuration.
    - Update the upstream configuration documentation URL.
    - The reason for switching native.logger to syslog is now obsolete
      (but the package still does that, possibly to be reconsidered
      later).
  * Remove the (undefined) warn_log destination from the default
    native.logger configuration file, restoring consistency with the
    Debian modification to log to syslog.  Since all native logs go to
    syslog, there's no need to have differentiated log destinations based
    on threshold.  The previous version of the file referenced a
    commented-out warn_log destination, which caused errors to be spammed
    to syslog.
  * Build with GSS-API support.
  * Build and install FastCGI programs in /usr/lib/<triplet>/shibboleth.
    For right now, these are still included in libapache2-mod-shib2, which
    makes them substantially less useful than they would be in their own
    package.  Further work is required to allow the FastCGI programs plus
    shibd to be installed independent of the Apache module.
  * Add build dependency on libboost-dev.
  * Use log4shib instead of log4cpp.
  * Force build dependencies and package dependencies on xml-security-c
    1.7 or later, xmltooling 1.5 or later, and opensaml2 2.5 or later to
    ensure everything is consistent.
  * Remove explicit build dependency on libtool.  This is now handled by
    dh-autoreconf.
  * Add Multi-Arch: same to libshibsp-dev and Multi-Arch: foreign to
    libshibsp-doc and shibboleth-sp2-schemas.
  * Remove Conflicts with libapache2-mod-shib.  lenny is dead.
  * Fix the libshibsp-doc package name in the Suggests on libshibsp-dev
    and remove the nonstandard version constraint.
  * Install the upstream doc/RELEASE.txt file as the upstream changelog.
    It's not exactly a changelog, but it has pointers to the upstream web
    documentation of changes, which is probably what people are looking for.
  * Drop postinst code to handle upgrades from the Shibboleth 1.x module,
    which was last included in lenny.
  * Switch to xz compression for the repackaged upstream
    source, *.debian.tar, and the *.deb packages.
  * Update upstream Homepage.
  * Canonicalize the URLs in the Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4.
    - Update debian/copyright to specify copyright-format 1.0.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.4.3+dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix syntax error in the update-rc.d invocation for shibd, which was
    not visible on most Debian systems because of dependency-based boot.
    Thanks to Evan Broder and Steve Langasek for pointing me in the right
    direction.  (LP: #884402)
  * Add PIE to the hardening flags for the shibd binary.
  * Use memcached_last_error_message instead of the cached_errno member of
    the memcached_st struct, since the latter was removed in 1.0.  Thanks
    to Michael Fladischer for the patch.  Bump Build-Depends to require
    1.0 or later of libmemcached-dev.  (Closes: #658408)
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages the team
    builds, and NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.

    g++ 4.5 and 4.6 die with an internal compiler error even with no
    optimization.  Patch from Peter Green.  (Closes: #623263)
  * Change the default native.logger facility to 3 from 3 << 3, since the
    current log4cpp does indeed do the facility shift.  Thanks to Jeremy
    Maryott for the report.  (Closes: #638594)
  * Update the upstream download location in debian/copyright.
  * Fix some formatting issues in debian/copyright caught by Lintian.

  * Fix LSB Description keyword formatting in the shibd init script.
  * Empty the Default-Stop setting for the shibd init script.  Just

  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
  * Update debian/copyright to the current DEP-5 specification.
