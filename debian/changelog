shibboleth-sp2 (2.1.dfsg1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream version.
    - New memory cache storage backend.
    - Schema validation is now optional.
    - Many bug fixes.
  * Bump SONAME of libshibsp following upstream's versioning.
  * Build-depend on libsaml2-dev >= 2.1 following the upstream spec file
    and libxmltooling-dev 1.1 just in case (required by OpenSAML 2.1).
  * Fix the name of the tarball created by get-orig-source.
  * Logcheck rules.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Follow the libshibsp1->2 package rename in the dh_makeshlibs invocation.
  * Remove the Shibboleth minor version number from README.Debian.
  * Comment out the reference to WS-Trust.xsd from the catalog.xml file in
    shibboleth-sp2-schemas and document how to enable it again.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Rename debian/shib.load to debian/shib2.load to avoid clashing with the
    libapache2-mod-shib package.  Otherwise its Apache config file breaks our
    module.
  * Add directory /var/log/shibboleth to libapache2-mod-shib2 (thanks to Peter
    Schober for noticing)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add a postinst to disable the old configuration on upgrade and enable
    the module if it had been enabled under the old configuration name.
  * Wait for shibd to exit on stop or restart.  This fixes a bug in
    restart that could lead to no new shibd being started because the old
    one had not yet exited.
  * Fix a syntax error in the shibd man page.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Avoid brace expansion in debian/rules, dash does not like it.
    (Closes: #493408)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add logcheck rules to ignore some of the routine messages from the
    Apache module.  This only covers startup and teardown; more will
    need to be added.
  * Fix watch file for new upstream tarball naming.
