shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Rename debian/shib.load to debian/shib2.load to avoid clashing with the
    libapache2-mod-shib package.  Otherwise its Apache config file breaks our
    module.
  * Add directory /var/log/shibboleth to libapache2-mod-shib2 (thanks to Peter
    Schober for noticing).

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add a postinst to disable the old configuration on upgrade and enable
    the module if it had been enabled under the old configuration name.
  * Wait for shibd to exit on stop or restart.  This fixes a bug in
    restart that could lead to no new shibd being started because the old
    one had not yet exited.

shibboleth-sp2 (2.0.dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Avoid brace expansion in debian/rules, dash does not like it.
    (Closes: #493408)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add logcheck rules to ignore some of the routine messages from the
    Apache module.  This only covers startup and teardown; more will
    need to be added.
  * Fix watch file for new upstream tarball naming.
